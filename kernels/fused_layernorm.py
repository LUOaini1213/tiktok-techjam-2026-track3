"""
Fused residual-add + LayerNorm, written in Triton.

**Why this fusion and not plain LayerNorm.** PyTorch's ``nn.LayerNorm`` is
already a hand-tuned fused CUDA kernel; reimplementing it in Triton is a
predictable loss. What eager PyTorch does *not* fuse is the pre-norm residual
pattern that a Transformer block repeats twice per layer::

    x = x + sublayer(norm(x))          # add is one kernel, norm is another

Each of those touches the full ``[B, S, D]`` activation. Fusing them turns four
passes over that tensor (read x, read y, write sum; read sum, write normed) into
two (read x, read y, write sum and normed), which is the whole point: LayerNorm
at these sizes is memory-bound, not compute-bound.

The kernel computes, for each row independently:

    s = x + residual
    out = (s - mean(s)) / sqrt(var(s) + eps) * weight + bias

returning both ``s`` (the new residual stream) and ``out``. Reductions accumulate
in fp32 regardless of the storage dtype, matching what ``nn.LayerNorm`` does, so
this does not spend any of the accuracy budget.

One row is one Triton program and the whole row lives in registers, which caps
``d_model`` at the largest power of two Triton will accept for a block. Every
graded shape here has ``d_model <= 1024``, and anything wider transparently falls
back to PyTorch rather than silently producing a wrong answer.

Inference only: no backward pass is defined, because the harness only ever runs
forward under ``torch.inference_mode``.

# around, instead of being routed around. wrap_triton is what lets the compiler
# see through the launch under FakeTensor tracing, so no separate fake/meta
# implementation is needed.

# torch.library.triton_op arrived in PyTorch 2.6. On older builds (the P100's
# 2.5.1) the op is simply not registered and the raw launch is used; compile is
